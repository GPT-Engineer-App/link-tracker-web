# link-tracker-web


Dear GPT Engineer,

I'm looking for your assistance in developing a simple web application that allows users to add and track links, with a user-friendly interface. The application should have the following features:

1. A homepage that displays all added links and their traffic counts.
2. A form for adding new links, with fields for the link name and URL.
3. A feature for tracking link traffic, which increments the traffic count for a link each time it is clicked.
4. A meta refresh tag that redirects the user to the link's URL when they click on the link name, with each link generating a meta refresh page that functions independently, without manual adjustment needed.
5. A feature for renaming links, allowing users to update the name of a link without changing its URL.
6. A feature for deleting links, allowing users to remove links from the application.
7. Basic error handling for invalid URLs and duplicate link names.
8. A clean and intuitive user interface that is easy to navigate and use.

In addition to these features, I'd like to suggest adding a feature for sorting links by traffic count, which would allow users to easily identify their most popular links.

To develop the application, I'd like to use Python and Flask, a lightweight web framework. I'd appreciate it if you could provide a complete solution, including the Python code for the application and any necessary HTML templates.
